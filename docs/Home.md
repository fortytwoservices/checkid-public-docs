# Welcome to CheckID

**CheckID** is a secure and user-friendly onboarding solution that simplifies the first-time sign-in experience for new employees in your organization.

Instead of relying on temporary passwords, manual user setup, and IT bottlenecks, CheckID allows users to authenticate themselves using familiar identity sources:

- BankID  
- Vipps  
- ID-porten
- MitID (Denmark)

Once verified, users are automatically provisioned with access to their Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) account — fast, secure, and fully compliant.

## Key Benefits

- Zero IT stress: No need to manually create users or distribute temporary passwords.
- Frictionless for the user: Uses what they already know — BankID, Vipps, or ID-porten.
- Secure by design: Built on Microsoft Entra ID and follows Zero Trust principles.
- Quick to implement: We deploy directly in your Azure environment.
- Fully Norwegian (for now): With plans for broader Nordic ID support.

## How It Works

1. The new employee goes to `yourorg.checkid.no` (Optional custom domain) on their phone or laptop.
2. They choose their preferred ID method (BankID, Vipps, or ID-porten).
3. After secure authentication, CheckID:
   - Connects to your Microsoft Entra ID tenant
   - Creates a Temporary Access Pass (TAP)
   - Provides the user with credentials to access their account and enroll their device

## Pilot Program

CheckID is currently in private preview, and we're inviting selected pilot customers to try it out — for free.
