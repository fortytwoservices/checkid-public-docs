# Require approved or protected app policy

If you have a conditional access policy that always require compliant device, you will run into issues where the user cannot register a passkey during onboarding. To work around this issue, [Microsoft has documented some methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-support-authenticator-passkey#users-who-cant-register-passkeys-because-of-require-approved-client-app-or-require-app-protection-policy-conditional-access-grant-controls). CheckID supports the **Allow the exemption for only a limited period of time** workaround through the [Onboarding Group](Onboarding-Group.md) feature.
